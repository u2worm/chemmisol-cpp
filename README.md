# ⚗️ CHEMMISOL

CHEMMISOL is a performant chemical equilibrium solver built in the context of the CAMMISOL project.

Widely inspired by the [VMinteq](https://vminteq.com/) software, its main purpose is to compute mineral adsorption model speciation equations, but it can be used to find the equilibrium state of any pure solution chemical system.
